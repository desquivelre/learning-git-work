# Learning the workflow of git and github interface

This repository was used to learn Git Console and GitHub.

In this repository, I practiced how:
- To install and configurate Git (global attributes)
- The local, stage, commit and remote area work.
- To manage different branches (merge, rebase, push and pull operations)
- The features of GitHub enviromente and workflow.

> **Note:**  In my opinion, I strongly agree to get into Git Console with GitHub when you do teamwork.
